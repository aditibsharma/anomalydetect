I have created initial structure of flask directories and committed in repo

1. Flask directories
 Please do not change the file names , but you can change the contents inside the files.
 
 
2. Template directory has 3 template files 
index.html
submit_complete.html
upload_complete.html

Aditi, you can overwrite these with your code for 3 pages as we discussed.

3. 
\static\js\code.js file is used for keeping js code.

Aditi please overwrite this file with your code.

4. 
\static\images directory can be used to keep any static image files

5. 
\db\analysis.py file should have code for fx_analysis and fx_result used by app.py 

Nish is responsble for that 

6. 
\db\supervised.py file should have code for supervised learning 

Bill is responsble for that 


7. 
\db\unsupervised.py file should have code for supervised learning 

Nish is responsble for that 



8. 
\app.py file has main code for the pages.

Anyone can update that if needed.

1. Ask user to upload the file. --Template index.html

2. User press upload button --Template upload_complete.html

a. Unique ID is allocated to this operation and its folder has been created on server and 
    saved the file to this new folder. Let's call this .\db\data\uk_id 
    Get first row from the file and parse the data
    Show appropiate data like 	
    
	column name from the file, and ask user to assign type of column to each column name.
